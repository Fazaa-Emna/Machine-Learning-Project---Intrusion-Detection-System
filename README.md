# **Machine Learning Project - Intrusion Detection System**

This project focuses on developing an Intrusion Detection System (IDS) using Machine Learning to enhance cybersecurity in network applications. The approach follows the CRISP-DM methodology and involves several key steps and techniques to build and evaluate the system.

## **Project Highlights**

- **Data Preprocessing:** Techniques applied to clean and prepare the dataset for modeling.
- **Feature Selection:** Recursive Feature Elimination (RFE) and Principal Component Analysis (PCA) were used to identify and reduce features for optimal performance.
- **Classification Models:** 
  - Logistic Regression
  - K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
  - Support Vector Machine (SVM)
  - Decision Tree
  - Ensemble Learning techniques
- **Clustering Algorithms:**
  - Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM)
  - K-Means

This project demonstrates the integration of various machine learning techniques to detect and prevent unauthorized access in network environments.
